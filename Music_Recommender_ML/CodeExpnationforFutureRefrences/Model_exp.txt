1. Importing Libraries:
   - import pandas as pd: Imports pandas library as pd.
   - from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier: Imports DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.tree.
   - from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split: Imports train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.
   - from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score: Imports accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics.
   - import joblib: Imports joblib library.

2. Loading Data:
   - df=pd.read_csv('music.csv'): Reads data from 'music.csv' into a DataFrame called df.

3. Data Preparation:
   - X=df.drop(columns=['genre']): Creates X with features by dropping 'genre' column.
   - Y=df['genre']: Creates Y with target variable 'genre'.

4. Splitting Data:
   - X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X,Y, test_size=0.2): Splits data into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).

5. Building the Model:
   - model= DecisionTreeClassifier(): Initializes Decision Tree classifier.
   - model.fit(X_train, Y_train): Fits the model to the training data.

6. Making Predictions:
   - predictions =model.predict(X_test): Generates predictions on the test data.

7. Saving the Model:
   - joblib.dump(model, 'music_recommender.joblib'): Saves the trained model to 'music_recommender.joblib'.

8. Evaluating the Model (Commented out):
   - # score=accuracy_score(Y_test, predictions): Calculates model accuracy (commented out).
